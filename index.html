          <p><span class="navy-on-gold">Prior to programming, I spent 5 years in the legal industry doing everything but law - namely, event management, excel wizardry, and process improvement projects.</span></p>

          <p><span class="navy-on-gold">All of these roles were people focused and I've brought that people-first mentality with me to the tech world. (You might be surprised at how much overlap there is between designing an app and an event!)</span></p>

          <p><span class="navy-on-gold">When I'm not coding, I love going to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/but-what-will-the-k-nearest-neighbors-think-a21f3f736898" target="_blank">comedy shows</a>, enjoying live music, and using my computer for other creative pursuits - writing, graphic design, videography. Otherwise, I'm probably snuggling with my cat, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9cGiMwpjyT/" target="_blank">Zelda</a>, or my rescue pup, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXqyCFqB8Kq/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>.</span></p>

          <p>Let's Do Something encourages users to try new things in their city and takes the hassle out of organizing the plans. The app allows users to save ideas of what they would like to do in their city, add friends, and host events. When hosting an event, the user can select up to three ideas and their guests vote on which idea sounds best. The host can end the poll at any time. Polls that have votes registered will return the winner based on vote count. Polls without votes will generate a random idea from the ideas selections. All participants are notified of the winning results.</p>

          <p>Regular Status was made with bartenders in mind - Users can save custom cocktail recipes and study them in a quiz game. Users can hide or delete recipes as they are mastered. Users win by filling their glass (fills 10% for each correct answer) and achieving regular status with the bartender. If users let their glass reach empty after too many wrong answers (-10% for each wrong answer), they'll be cut off.</p>

          <p>TV Tracker lets you save and review the shows you are watching, want to watch, and have watched. You can search through an existing database of shows to find new shows to watch, or add a show if it doesn't exist yet.  On the show's page you will find a description and where you can watch it, along with reviews (if the show has any) and an average rating. Your homepage also provides watch stats so you can see which of your subscription services you're using and which ones are a waste.</p>

          <p>Mock BnB is a React mock of AirBnB. For this exercise, we focused on ironining out a nimble backend model in our Rails API and creating a clean component structure on the frontend. The user (acting as a guest) can browse for open properties, filter for desired amenities, and book a stay. I worked in a team of three to work on this and practice pair programming and project management on a team.</p>
